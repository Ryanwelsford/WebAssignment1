                    "I am not a designer nor did I know much about grid theory before stumbling upon the CSS Grid Layout specification, so don't take my word for it and go look it up yourself, but if you don't care to, here's my pitch about it:"</p>
                <p>
                    "In essence, a grid is a set of invisible vertical and horizontal lines that the various design and content pieces of a web page, magazine or newspaper are positioned on."</p>
                <p>
                    "The goal of a grid is to serve as a base for placing the various pieces of content and to make sure these pieces are aligned and spaced out evenly.
                    A grid, even if not visible, provides the viewer with a way to navigate content visually.."</p>
                    <!--paras spaced out looks alot better on web pages IMO-->

            <h3>"So what has CSS got to do with it?"</h3>
            <p>
                "CSS is getting a set of entirely new properties that, when used together, allow you to define grids for your web content to go onto.
                These properties are defined in the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-1/">CSS Grid Layout specification."  </a>
            </p>
            <!-- as linked within original article decided to keep it in without wanting to edit original concept-->
            <p>
                "CSS hasnâ€™t particularly been known for its ability to handle complex layouts. Although this may not have been a problem when CSS first came out, it has evolved to be a pretty common one over the years as all sorts of complex layouts couldnâ€™t be easily implemented."
            </p>
            <p>
                "People have been very creative at getting around the lack of support by using floats or absolute positioning and a variety of CSS layout frameworks emerged"
            </p>

                "So itâ€™s about time CSS got some proper layout solutions to support today's use cases."

                <h3>"Can I Use It?"</h3>
                <p>
                    "Yes you can start using it today, but only Chrome has implemented the specification far enough to play with grids, and you need to turn the experimental Web Platform features flag on."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "IE has an early implementation (dating back to IE10) too but the spec has evolved since it was added and so itâ€™s not entirely compatible with it anymore."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Firefox has started implementing it too so it shouldnâ€™t be too long before you can use it in this browser."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Finally, a polyfill exists, so you have no excuses not to start experimenting (and I strongly encourage you do)!"
                </p>
